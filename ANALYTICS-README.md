- **Fanning Out:** Matches spread out as compatibility decreases
- **Visual Appeal:** Tree/pyramid structure for intuitive understanding

### Page Details
- **URL:** `?page=pm` (Pyramid Match)
- **Page Name:** `PyramidMatch.html` (or similar)
- **Backend:** Matching functions in Code.gs or separate file
- **Config:** `MATCH_CONFIG` object (separate from CONFIG)

## üßÆ Algorithm Design Questions

### 1. **Matching Philosophy**
- [ ] **Similar matching** - People with same interests/traits?
- [ ] **Complementary matching** - Opposites attract (e.g., introvert + extrovert)?
- [ ] **Balanced matching** - Mix of both?
- [ ] **Your approach:** ___________________________

### 2. **Weighting Strategy**
Which attributes matter most? (Assign weights 1-10, 10 = most important)

```
Shared Interests:     ___ / 10  (they have common hobbies)
Music Taste:          ___ / 10  (similar music preference)
Social Compatibility: ___ / 10  (intro/extrovert balance)
Industry/Career:      ___ / 10  (professional connection)
Age Proximity:        ___ / 10  (similar age range)
Zodiac Compatibility: ___ / 10  (astrological match)
Education Level:      ___ / 10  (similar education)
Geographic Proximity: ___ / 10  (nearby zip codes)
"At Worst" Traits:    ___ / 10  (compatible flaws)
Know Hosts:           ___ / 10  (social circle overlap)
```

### 3. **Scoring Method**

**Option A: Simple Additive**
```
Score = (shared_interests √ó weight) + (music_match √ó weight) + ...
```

**Option B: Percentage Match**
```
Score = (matched_attributes / total_attributes) √ó 100
```

**Option C: Tiered Scoring**
```
Tier 1 (Must Have): Interests, Music (heavy weight)
Tier 2 (Nice to Have): Industry, Education (medium weight)
Tier 3 (Bonus): Zodiac, Purchase type (light weight)
```

**Option D: Custom Formula**
```
Your formula: ___________________________
```

### 4. **Match Thresholds**

How many matches to show?
- **Level 1 (Closest):** Top ___ matches (directly under guest)
- **Level 2 (Good):** Next ___ matches (second tier)
- **Level 3 (Potential):** Next ___ matches (third tier, optional)

Minimum score to display?
- **Cutoff score:** ___ / 100 (or your scale)

### 5. **Exclusion Rules**

Should we exclude matches based on:
- [ ] **Self:** Can't match with yourself
- [ ] **Already connected:** If they already know each other?
- [ ] **Privacy:** Exclude orientation from algorithm?
- [ ] **Gender preferences:** Consider at all?
- [ ] **Other:** ___________________________

## üé® Visualization Design

### Pyramid Structure

```
                    [GUEST A]
                    (Selected)
                        |
          +-------------+-------------+
          |                           |
      [Match 1]                   [Match 2]
      95% match                   92% match
          |                           |
    +-----+-----+               +-----+-----+
    |           |               |           |
[Match 3]   [Match 4]      [Match 5]   [Match 6]
88% match   85% match      84% match   82% match
```

### Visual Elements
- **Photos:** From PHOTO_URL (CONFIG.COL.PHOTO_URL = 29)
- **Screen Names:** From CONFIG.COL.SCREEN_NAME (24)
- **Match Score:** Display as percentage or visual indicator
- **Connection Lines:** Animated lines between guests
- **Hover Details:** Show why they match (shared interests, etc.)

## üîß Technical Architecture

### MATCH_CONFIG Object
```javascript
const MATCH_CONFIG = {
  // Algorithm settings (to be defined)
  WEIGHTS: {
    INTERESTS: 10,    // Your weight here
    MUSIC: 8,         // Your weight here
    SOCIAL_STANCE: 6, // Your weight here
    // ... more weights
  },

  // Display settings
  MAX_MATCHES_LEVEL_1: 3,  // Top tier matches
  MAX_MATCHES_LEVEL_2: 6,  // Second tier matches
  MINIMUM_SCORE: 50,       // Minimum % to display

  // Privacy settings
  EXCLUDE_ORIENTATION: true,
  EXCLUDE_SELF: true
};
```

### Backend Functions Needed
```javascript
// 1. Get all checked-in guests with matching attributes
getMatchableGuests()

// 2. Calculate compatibility score between two guests
calculateCompatibility(guestA, guestB)

// 3. Find best matches for a specific guest
findBestMatches(targetGuest, allGuests, topN)

// 4. Format match data for pyramid display
formatMatchesForPyramid(targetGuest, matches)
```

---

## üìä Sample Algorithm Pseudocode

```javascript
function calculateCompatibility(guestA, guestB) {
  let score = 0;

  // Shared interests (highest weight?)
  const sharedInterests = countSharedInterests(guestA, guestB);
  score += sharedInterests * MATCH_CONFIG.WEIGHTS.INTERESTS;

  // Music compatibility
  if (guestA.music === guestB.music) {
    score += MATCH_CONFIG.WEIGHTS.MUSIC;
  }

  // Social stance compatibility (opposites or similar?)
  const stanceDiff = Math.abs(guestA.socialStance - guestB.socialStance);
  // TODO: Decide if closer is better or if opposites attract
  score += calculateSocialScore(stanceDiff);

  // ... more factors

  // Normalize to 0-100 scale
  return normalizeScore(score);
}
```

## ü§î Questions to Answer Together

### Algorithm Design
1. **For Social Stance (1-5 scale):**
   - Similar is better? (both introverts or both extroverts)
   - Opposites attract? (introvert + extrovert = balance)
   - Middle ground? (both ambiverts)

2. **For Shared Interests:**
   - Need all 3 to match? (strict)
   - Any 1 match counts? (lenient)
   - More matches = better score? (proportional)

3. **For Age Range:**
   - Must be same range? ("25-29" + "25-29")
   - Adjacent ranges OK? ("25-29" + "30-34")
   - Age difference doesn't matter?

4. **For Music/Artist:**
   - Match on genre (Music) or specific artist?
   - Both count?
   - Weight differently?

5. **Geographic Proximity:**
   - Should nearby zip codes score higher?
   - How much does distance matter?
   - Metro vs non-metro consideration?
