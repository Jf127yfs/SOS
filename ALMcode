/**
 * ============================================================================
 * ALM - AUTOMATED LEADERSHIP MATCHER (Dance Team Generator)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Converted from Python implementation - Pyramid matchmaking for dance teams
 *
 * ALGORITHM: Creates teams of 6 dancers in pyramid structure:
 * - Row 1: 1 focal dancer (leader)
 * - Row 2: 2 dancers (high compatibility)
 * - Row 3: 3 dancers (supporting cast)
 *
 * FEATURES:
 * - Auto-generated team names based on collective traits
 * - Photo URL support
 * - Genre mixing for diversity
 * - Similarity scoring (interests, music, age)
 * - Batch team generation
 * - Abby Lee-style commentary
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES:
 * - FRC sheet with checked-in guest data
 * - Columns: Screen Name, UID, Checked-In, PHOTO_URL, Music, Age, Interests
 *
 * CALLED BY: ALM.html via google.script.run
