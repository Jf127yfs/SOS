🎮 HOW IT WORKS

AUTOMATIC 10-MINUTE CYCLES:

   • Prisoners → Hospital/Church
   • Others → Random weighted locations

2. STORY GENERATION (0:01)
   • System scans all locations
   • Generates interactions:
     - 2+ villagers → Cooperation/conflict/trade
     - 1 villager → Solo reflection
     - Woods villagers → Surreal events
   • Writes narrative entry
   • Auto-scrolls storybook

3. MOVEMENT (0:03 - 9:57)
   • Villagers move along paths
   • 1-3 hops per cycle
   • Smooth animations
   • No movement in Woods (exiles stay)

4. CYCLE END (10:00)
   • Cycle increments
   • Restart at step 1
   • Continuous loop!

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🌲 WITCHES' WOODS MECHANICS

WHO GOES TO THE WOODS:
• FRC (Column AA) ≥ 5 violations
• DDD > 6
• Automatically detected each cycle

NORMAL WOODS EVENTS (1-2 exiles):
• "Deep in the Witches' Woods, @User heard the sound of 
   their own footsteps answering back."
• "@User wandered into the Woods. Under moonlight, the 
   trees murmured their name. When dawn came, their eyes 
   were silvered."
• "The Woods claimed @User for the night. They emerged 
   speaking less, but listening more."

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS (3+ exiles):
• "The Witches' Woods grew restless. 3 souls wandered within. 
   Village cats began speaking in riddles. Children fell into 
   deep slumber. Small fires sparked from nowhere."
• "With 4 exiles in the Woods, the trees whispered chaos. 
   Villagers reported fever dreams. The farm's chickens 
   refused to lay eggs. Shadows moved against the light."

Effects on village:
- Villagers get sick
- Animals transform (cats speak, chickens stop laying)
- People fall asleep randomly
- Fires appear
- Mirrors show wrong reflections
- Church bell rings on its own

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS

SOURCE DATA:
• "Form Responses 1" sheet

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

→ Generate bios first
→ At least 1 villager with Checked-In = Y

Woods is empty
→ FRC column needs ≥5 for exiles
→ Or DDD > 6
→ Check source data has values

Storybook doesn't scroll
→ Browser may block auto-scroll
→ Manually scroll down once
→ Should auto-scroll after that

Catastrophic events not triggering
→ Need 3+ villagers in Woods simultaneously
→ Check FRC values in source sheet

Timer doesn't countdown
→ Refresh the interface
→ Check browser console for errors
